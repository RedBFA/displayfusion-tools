What this project is and who should use it
- Purpose: Provide a cohesive toolset for DisplayFusion users who want to simplify tasks that involve multiple monitors. The project centers on three core capabilities: TitleBar buttons, monitor profile management, and window snapping. It brings consistency to window placement, actions on the title bar, and profiles for different monitor arrangements.
- Audience: Desktop power users, system admins who configure multi-monitor rigs, gamers who run multi-monitor setups for immersion, designers who rely on precise window layouts, and developers who test DisplayFusion workflows.
- Outcome: A stable, extendable toolkit that reduces manual adjustments and speeds up common workflows. The tools are designed to be reliable in daily use and easy to extend with new features or integrations.

Core features
- Title Bar Buttons: Create, customize, and map actions to buttons on window title bars. You can assign common actions like snap, move, maximize, or launch apps. The system favors clarity and predictability so users can rely on the same button behavior across apps.
- Monitor Profiles: Save and switch between monitor configurations. Profiles capture resolution, scaling, orientation, and app window layouts. This makes it easy to transition between work, gaming, and presentation modes without reconfiguring each monitor individually.
- Window Snapping: Advanced snapping rules that align windows to edges, grids, or centers. The snapping engine respects the primary display and adapts when you switch profiles or plug in new displays.
- Stability-first design: The tools are built with fault tolerance in mind. If a setting fails to apply, the system will report a clear error and suggest remediation steps rather than crash.
- Extensibility: The architecture supports plugins and scripts so you can add new actions or measurements without changing the core codebase.

Getting started
- Why this toolkit exists: It reduces friction in multi-monitor work and makes complex layouts reliable. It helps you get consistent results when moving apps between displays, snapping windows, or restoring layouts after a reboot.
- What you need to run it: A Windows PC with DisplayFusion installed and compatible with your monitors. Administrative privileges are sometimes helpful for applying system-wide changes, but many features can work with standard user access.
- What you will do first: Install the latest release from the Releases page, verify that DisplayFusion is present, and run the setup or installer provided in the release artifacts. The Releases page is the central source for binaries, installers, and documentation updates.

Installation details
- Source of truth for binaries: The releases page is where you should download the official artifacts. If the link has a path part, write that file needs to be downloaded and executed. In this case, the releases page provides installers or zip archives for the toolkit.
- Step-by-step:
  1) Open the Releases page: https://github.com/RedBFA/displayfusion-tools/releases
  2) Download the latest release suitable for your system (installer or zip).
  3) If you downloaded a zip, extract it to a working folder.
  4) Run the installer or the provided executable. If you use a zip, locate the main executable and run it.
  5) Follow on-screen prompts to complete the setup. You may need to approve changes in the system prompt for installing shell integration or context menu items.
  6) After installation, restart your shell or sign out and back in if required.
- Verification: After installation, verify that the toolkit starts and that the UI is visible. Check that DisplayFusion is running properly and that your monitors are detected. A quick test of Title Bar Buttons, a profile switch, and a window snap will confirm basic functionality.
- Clean install notes: If you upgrade, uninstall the previous version only if the installer does not automatically replace files. Retain your profiles and settings when possible, but back them up in case of future compatibility changes.

How to use the tools
- Opening the toolkit: Launch from the Start menu or a desktop shortcut created during installation. The main window provides a clear view of available actions and current monitor status.
- Title Bar Buttons basics:
  - Add a new button: Choose an action from a list or define a custom action.
  - Map to a window type: Apply the button to all windows or specific applications.
  - Use icons and labels: Clear icons help you identify actions quickly.
  - Keyboard alternative: Bind the same actions to keyboard shortcuts for fast access.
- Monitor Profiles basics:
  - Create a profile: Capture current monitor layout, scaling, and window positions.
  - Save and name: Use descriptive names like “Work Desktop,” “Gaming Setup,” or “Presentation Mode.”
  - Apply a profile: Switch to a profile with a single click or a keyboard shortcut.
  - Manage conflicts: If two profiles have conflicting window positions, the toolkit prompts you to resolve the conflict.
- Window Snapping basics:
  - Snap regions: Define vertical and horizontal snapping zones, centers, or grids.
  - Snap behavior: Decide whether snapping is instant or animated.
  - Interaction: Use hotkeys to snap active windows into a desired region.
- Example scenarios:
  - Scenario 1: Work mode with three monitors. Create a profile that places tools on the left monitor, reference apps in the middle, and the main windows on the right. Use title bar buttons to quickly move a window to the correct monitor.
  - Scenario 2: Presentation mode. Snap a full-screen window to a primary monitor and hide other windows to reduce distraction. Switch to a dedicated monitor profile with clear boundaries.
  - Scenario 3: Gaming setup. Map a set of game and chat windows with snapping to keep the action on screen. Use title bar buttons to lock layout during gameplay.

Configuration and customization
- Settings overview: The toolkit stores its settings in a structured format. You can back up these files, and you can restore a configuration if needed.
- Changing defaults: You can adjust default actions for title bar buttons, define global snapping behavior, and set default monitor profiles for new sessions.
- Profiles management:
  - Create, rename, duplicate, and delete profiles.
  - Export profiles to share with teammates or save to a version control system.
  - Import profiles from other setups to quickly replicate a known good configuration.
- Snapping rules:
  - Create grids that align windows in a visual pattern.
  - Toggle snapping for specific monitors or window classes.
  - Configure margins, gaps, and snapping sensitivity.
- UI customization:
  - Choose themes, fonts, and icon sets.
  - Resize panels or hide nonessential controls to reduce distraction.
  - Enable or disable notification banners for actions.

Deep dives: Title Bar Buttons, Monitor Profiles, Window Snapping
- Title Bar Buttons
  - Design philosophy: Keep buttons small and meaningful. Provide immediate feedback when pressed. Support both standard Windows actions and custom commands.
  - Common actions:
    - Snap to left/might-right halves
    - Move window to next monitor
    - Maximize to current monitor
    - Minimize to tray or taskbar
    - Launch a predefined app or script
  - Advanced options:
    - Conditional logic based on window class or application type
    - Context-sensitive actions that appear only for certain apps
    - Multi-step workflows that chain several actions
  - Best practices:
    - Use intuitive icons so users can recognize actions at a glance
